# MULTIREADING-ENERGYMETER-FOR-DOMESTIC-LOADS
Watthour meter or energy meter is an instrument which measures the amount of electric power used by the consumer. In the power system there are different types of loads available such as Domestic loads, Commercial loads, Agricultural loads, Industrial loads , Municipal loads Rather than agricultural loads , municipal loads , industrial loads, commercial loads ;domestic loads use a number of energy meters for each building. In the present day scenario as the population increases day by day the load on the power system also increases, which in turn increases the houses .By this reason the number of energy meters also increases in domestic loads. Due to this reason size of the system increases, cost increases, occupy more space and also time consuming process for taking readings from each energy meter.This project deals to decrease the difficulty design of multi-energy meter for domestic load, which uses only one pressure coils and current coils which mainly depends upon the number of houses.â€ƒ
